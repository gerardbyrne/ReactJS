# ReactJS
An introduction to ReactJS

# Notes and exercises
Included in the repository is a Word document that contains a set of notes on ReactJS. It also includes step by step exercises that get you to create ReactJS code within HTML pages. Each exercise is aimed at developing one point (or aspect of ReactsJS. The exercises are mostly standalone although some build on the previous exercise.

# Code
Whilst the code is included in the notes and exercises, the code is also included as separate files in case you need a working copy. It is also important to type the code yourself with the help of an IDE that will autocomplete rather than simply copying and pasting the code.

# Learning
Remember that the whole purpose of following this course is for you to learn. So also remember that learning means understanding all the code that you enter. If you do no understand the code make a note of what you do not understand and follow up by searching the internet or by asking someone to help you understand the code.
